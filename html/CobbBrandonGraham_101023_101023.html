                Hey. Its like 2 am and I woke up feeling horrible; almost throwing up.
                I'm pretty sure it's because of my Vraylar.
                <br>
                Now its about 1pm and I'm making lentils.
                I "stole" my Mom's deskmat and reorganized my room.
                I feel a lot better now and can't picture why.
                Perhaps I could wonder about it, but lately everyone is telling me thinking about one thing for long enough is obsessive.
                I get angry when people identify me as obsessive because I think its like the "point out the sliver in others eyes and miss the plank in yours" or something like that.
                Specifically, I know I really don't mind especially if they are older than me, but dang its not easy to jump out of conversations.
                It is so weird having so many different diagnoses and none of them aligning with what I think to be true.
                Unless its LSD jk jk i meant OCD.
                OCD is like this habit I have where everything has extreme importance and it is hard to convince me out of it because its a delusion of grandieur.
                For instance, every time I "know" I'm past my breaking point I really fuck things up.
                Drugs seem to be my main issue, but dang how am I supposed to avoid this shit when its so cheap and legal?
                <br>
                One time my Dad bought me and my sister these little no nic vapes from Amazon and since those were deemed "wrong" in our household, I can't use anything like it anymore.
                The dude literally bought me a drug habit and then revoked my freedom to use it.
                It fucking sucks because I know I'd find a way to quit it if I had the damn freedom to fuck it up once or twice.
                Like fr, a few puffs and I'd be done.
                "Nooooooooooooo you're a drug addict, just one more hit is chasing the dragon."
                And I'm like, "bro I don't even like smoking, its fucking unattractive; but yo like ain't nobody in my life rn who loves me like a spouse so who tf cares if I do it privately. Who?? Her?? Doubt it."
                <br>
                Speaking of that girl, I swear she's like right around the corner from me (time-wise), but I have a lot more work to do to deserve a girl.
                For instance, I don't brush my teeth entirely the same way every day.
                I keep making up this excuse that it's because I don't have proof that brushing my teeth with like toothpaste and flossing twice a day is even good for me.
                Fuck, I gotta go brush my shit, brb.
                Ugh, I don't want to blog anymore rn.
                <br>
                Okay its a few hours later. I feel so shitty. I feel like I have all this energy, no interest in expending it and I can't focus on any task with my back pain.
                I honestly hope I throw up just so I have an excuse to stay med compliant and not feel this way.
                Surprisingly, I trust my body to throw up when it's fed up and I was really close this morning so it might be tomorrow.
                Pretty shit huh?
                Lol.
                <br>
                Love,
                <br>

            <h2>Topic: Creatine</h2>
            <p>
                I started taking creatine last night.
                Who knows if it will have the desired outcome of improved cognition and physical appearance.
                Essentially, if I'm in a better mood because of its effects I'll be satisfied.
                <br>
                My experience today has kindof been colored by it and I am ruminating about it;
                a common symptom of OCD
                Speaking of OCD, I really do not identify with the OCD parts of myself and it is upsetting.
                I experience symptoms of OCD and then those symptoms make me have more symptoms.
                Personally, I think I would have been fine if COVID-19 didn't exist, but it does so I don't really know what to do about it now.
                I do wear masks a lot more frequently now, I wash my hands in a very specific way and I bought air purifiers.
                It appears my aversion to COVID-19 is related to me smoking so maybe if I never smoked, I wouldn't be so poor off due to the pandemic.
                Yeah; thats the idea I'm running with.
                <br>
                I guess I don't really know why I smoked.
                I knew it was taboo with my parents, but thats what vices are anyway:
                Tabbo acts that for some reason we are allowed to do.
                <br>
                My vice is smoking.
                I would say pornography is also a vice of mine, but I'm really not one to identify with multiple vices.
                When I have no spouse caring for me, I tend to avoid pornography for vice purposes and instead use it as a tool to appreciate the bodies of others.
                Some people really want to be seen for their figure and I have some respect for them.
                <br>
                On the other hand, I really do hate smoking.
                I plan on replacing my vices with a girlfriend.
                She would be such a focus in my life that I wouldn't have time for smoking or pornography.
                I don't think time is the right word.
                It should be but it is not.
                The way it is framed has to do with feeling like smoking is unattractive so I wouldn't do it and pornography would be disrepectful to her.
                Now, I'm still addicted to women so I would really want her nude, but that means I have another vice to give up.
                To everyone else, that vice doesn't exist, but I know of one vice I simply never talk about which I would tell her I wouldn't want to do (she kindof has control over it).
                <br>
                I guess that means I'm a subordinant to my dominatrix.
                Fuck, thinking about being dominated is really hot.
                She could really ruin my psyche with that whole vice thing.
                Thankfully the whole being able to ruin me makes things hotter so unless she hates me I don't think she'll ruin me.
                She deserves to hold that authority over me though.
                <br>
                Sigh... she really needs a good fucking.
                Naughty wife.

                Love,
                <br>

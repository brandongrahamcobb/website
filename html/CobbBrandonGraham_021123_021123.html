            <h2>Topic: Microdosing</h2>
            <p>
                Whoever didn't consider caffeine first as a microdose drug is an idiot.
                Swallowing two beans of roasted coffee is the easiest way to get a caffeine microdose.
                To be even better at the microdose, drink hot water along with having some coffee beans in your mouth.
                Caffeine is great;
                people underestimate how powerful it is.
                <br>
                Speaking of which, I really rather be macrodosing cafcit.
                I think having a doctor prescribe to me a macrodose of caffeine would cure me.
                Unfortunately no docter in their professional mind would ever give me caffeine citrate.
                Sad.
                Also, there is no XR formulation of caffeine soz.
                <br>
                I think I want Provigil; which is a modafinil prescription.
                The problem with asking for Provigil is pregelatinized starch is an ingredient and I'm vegan.
                <br>
                Tomorrow I have an appointment with the psychiatrist so I hope it goes well.
                I might come out of the appointment really disappointed because I feel like I'm getting worse mentally.
                <br>
                Love,
                <br>
